# The Journey into Accessibility


---


# Learn the Types of Disabilities

- Cognitive Impairments
- Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Visual Impairments
- Hearing Impairments
- Physical/Mobility Impairments


```notes
  - Realize we have users with these problems, want to find help
```

# Google The Acronyms

- [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
- [WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
- [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
- [a11y](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a11y)


```notes
  - Find all the standards and guidelines
  - Find them pretty intimidating and (ironically) unaccessible
```

  - you found some javascript that will print out in the console what needs to be changed
  - figure out how to sort of use a screen reader
  - you start adding aria attributes to everything
```

# It Starts as a Design Problem

```notes
  - Go back to the drawing board
  - Not everything can be solved with aria
  - Screen readers aren't your only edge case
```

> “Accessible design is good design – it benefits people who don’t have disabilities as well as people who do. Accessibility is all about removing barriers and providing the benefits of technology for everyone.”

*Steve Ballmer*


```notes
  - The issue with aria all the things is accessibility, like design, is subjective.
  - That's what makes it hard.
  - As developers we like things to be clear cut and well defined
  - We wish there was just a definitive guide to making our apps 100% accessible.

 first could mimic dimmed lighting, joke about spending an entire hour figuring
 out how to dim lighting on the screen at the conference, you wouldn't believe
 how many filters I tried.x

could do a slide on dried out contacts, so everything is blurry, eyes red (spongebob meme?)
