```

# It Starts as a Design Problem

```notes
  - Go back to the drawing board
  - Not everything can be solved with aria
  - Screen readers aren't your only edge case
```

> “Accessible design is good design – it benefits people who don’t have disabilities as well as people who do. Accessibility is all about removing barriers and providing the benefits of technology for everyone.”
>
> *Steve Ballmer*


```notes
  - The issue with aria all the things is accessibility, like design, is subjective.
  - That's what makes it hard.
  - As developers we like things to be clear cut and well defined
  - We wish there was just a definitive guide to making our apps 100% accessible.
```

# Negativity Bias

People remember the <u>**bad**</u> more than the <u>**good**</u>


```notes
  - The little things make a big difference
  - All these examples are things most users would never notice.
  - The more we try to put ourselves in the shoes of our users, the easier it becomes to find these types of problems with our apps.
```


---


# Your app will never be 100% accessible


---


# and that's okay


```notes
  - In the end it's subjective, we can get close, but will never be able to please everyone or meet everyone's needs
  - But the more we try, the better it is for everyone
```


---


<Image src="public/images/god-entity.jpeg" size="contain" alt="When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all." />


```notes
  - Accessibility might not always be glamorous, but the end goal is to make life easier and reduce problems, even when they don't know they have a problem.
```

# That's it
